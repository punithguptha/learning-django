This project is about having users to enter some text in our site and then internally we apply some hashing algorithm and convert that text to the hashed code and display on the site.

This is done runtime (dynamically) as one types in the textarea the hashes are generated and displayed..This is done with help of ajax

Also the hashes are stored in the db once the user decides to press the hash button.
